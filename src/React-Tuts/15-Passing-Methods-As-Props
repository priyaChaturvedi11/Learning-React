May 8 - Methods as props 

- Parent component can pass down props to its children component as it is available for them
- For reverse, - props - by passing refernce to a method as props to a child component

- when you don't need a state in a component, use a simpler approach - use function component instead of class component
(shortcut rfce)

ChildComponent
clicking on button - we want to execute method defined in Parent component - pass itself as props to child component

for passing parameter to prop attribute you should use arrow functionn syntax for passing prop
// Inside child component
           {/*<button onClick={props.greetHandlerAttr}>Greet Parent</button>*/}
            <button onClick={() => props.greetHandlerAttr('child one')}>Greet Parent</button>


Steps broadly are:
1. make a parent component - gonna be a class since we need to store state
2. define a method for handling event in parent component
3. bind the event handler in parent's constructor
4. pass the method as prop to child component (child means it is in jsx of parent and parent could be in jsx of some grand parent) 
5. use the method or atttribute in child component while registering with event source and if you need to passs parameters to method, use arrow function syntax as shown above
