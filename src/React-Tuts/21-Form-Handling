MAY 11- FORM HANDLING

------
GOAL
------
Input in forms
In regular html, form elements are themself responsible for taking user input and update their respective values.
We want react to control elements of a form. Such form elements whose value is controlled by react are called 'controlled components'.

E.g, consider the text input field

<input type='text' value='' onChange='' />

Dealing with values that can change within a component:-
	Make use of state
	this.state = {
		email: ''
	}
	// In a controlled component, value of field is set to the state property.
	<input type='text' value={this.state.email} onChange={this.changeEmailHandler} />
	
	And setState
	this.changeEmailHandler = (event) => {
		this.setState({email: event.target.value})
	}
	
	
NOTE: FOR BETTER USER EXPERIENCE

When you use type="submit" on a button it allows user to submit the form by just pressing the enter key.
MIght be good for your case, might not be

If something very critical is being entered and user mistakenly presses enter key, all her progress will be lost

but think about choosing a color to generate a new pallete, user might want pressing of enter key to submit the form
